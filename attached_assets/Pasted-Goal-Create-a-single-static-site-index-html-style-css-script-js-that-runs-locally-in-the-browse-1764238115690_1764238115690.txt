Goal: Create a single static site (index.html, style.css, script.js) that runs locally in the browser (file://). No Node, no servers, no external JSON files. All data lives in script.js as JavaScript arrays/objects and in localStorage. The images/ folder is present in the same directory and contains meal and avatar images; use those images by filename.

Project structure (required)
/project-root
  /images                ← user-provided images (meal images, workout thumbnails, avatars, trainer images)
  index.html
  style.css
  script.js


Important: All image references must point to /images/<filename> (relative: images/...) and code must gracefully fall back to a placeholder if an image is missing.

Deliverables (exact)

index.html — semantic HTML with all sections and containers referenced by IDs and classes used in script.js. Include ARIA and alt text placeholders.

style.css — responsive styling, dark mode support, accessible colors, card grid layouts, modal styles, animations, and mobile-first design.

script.js — all site logic:

Inline data arrays (workouts, meals, challenges, friends, trainers)

Rendering functions to build DOM content

Event listeners and handlers

localStorage read/write with clear key names

Modal and form handling

Charts (Canvas API) for tracker

All features below

Global requirements & user experience

The site must run completely offline (except optional YouTube embeds). No fetch() to remote servers.

Use clear localStorage keys (see keys section).

Use progressive enhancement & accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, alt attributes).

All interactive elements (buttons, form controls) must be usable via keyboard and announced to screen readers.

All code must be vanilla JS (ES6+), modular functions, no frameworks.

Data model (examples — include at least the counts given)

Put these arrays directly in script.js. Use unique numeric id values.

Workouts (≥ 20)
const WORKOUTS = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Full Body HIIT",
    category: "HIIT",
    difficulty: "Intermediate",
    durationMin: 20,
    equipment: "Bodyweight",
    muscles: ["Full body"],
    thumbnail: "images/workout-1.jpg", // must exist
    videoUrl: "", // optional YouTube URL or empty
    description: "High-intensity interval session that targets full body. 6 rounds: 40s work / 20s rest.",
    caloriesEstimate: 250
  },
  // ... add 19+ more
];

Meal plans / recipes (≥ 30)
const MEALS = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Protein Oatmeal Bowl",
    category: "Breakfast",
    tags: ["high-protein"],
    image: "images/meal-1.jpg",
    calories: 420,
    macros: { protein: 30, carbs: 50, fat: 10 },
    prepTimeMin: 5,
    cookTimeMin: 5,
    difficulty: "Easy",
    ingredients: ["50g oats", "1 scoop protein", "200ml milk", "banana"],
    steps: ["Mix oats and milk", "Cook 2-3 minutes", "Stir in protein", "Top with banana"]
  },
  // ... add 29+ more
];

Challenges (must be interactive + local)

Design at least 6 challenges (e.g., 30-day push-up, 7-day hydration, 14-day yoga). Structure:

const CHALLENGES = [
  {
    id: "pushup-30",
    title: "30-Day Push-Up Challenge",
    durationDays: 30,
    startInstruction: "Start with 5 push-ups, increase gradually each day.",
    dailyPlan: [5,6,7,8,...], // array of length 30 with daily reps or instructions
    image: "images/challenge-pushup.jpg"
  },
  // ...
];

Friends (10 AI fillers) and Trainers (10)

Create arrays of 10 objects each with id, name, bio, avatar, interests/specialties, and for trainers rate, certifications, specialties, sampleAvailability.

const FRIENDS = [...10 objects...];
const TRAINERS = [...10 objects...];

localStorage keys (exact names)

fw_user_profile — object with name, about, avatarDataUrl

fw_favorites_workouts — Array<number> of workout ids

fw_favorites_meals — Array<number> of meal ids

fw_challenge_progress — object keyed by challenge id containing progress state (startDate, dayCompleted[], streak)

fw_tracker_data — object for daily steps, weight history, water logs, workouts logged

fw_friends — array of friend suggestions / connections (persist adds)

fw_bookings — array of trainer booking objects

fw_reviews — (if implemented) array of reviews

Scripts must check for existing data and initialize defaults if absent.

Feature details (functionality you asked for)
1) Make Challenges work locally (full behavior)

UI: Challenge list page with cards (image, title, duration, start button). Clicking a challenge opens a modal with:

challenge overview

progress bar (days completed / total)

day-by-day list with checkboxes to mark completion

Previous/Next day navigation

“Reset challenge” button and “Complete Day” button

Persistence: When user marks a day complete, update fw_challenge_progress[challengeId]:

fw_challenge_progress = {
  "pushup-30": { startDate: "2025-11-27", completedDays: [1,2,3], streak: 3 }
}


Progress visualization: Show percent complete, circular progress (SVG or canvas), and longest streak.

Notifications: Optional daily reminder via local browser alert (user has to click allow in session); store preference on profile.

Reset/Abandon: "Reset challenge" clears progress for that challenge in localStorage with confirmation.

2) Use the images folder for meal plans

Meal objects image property must reference images/<filename>.jpg (or png).

If image not found, show images/placeholder-meal.jpg.

Provide lazy-loading loading="lazy" for large images.

On the meal list page show grid cards with title, short macro summary, and click to open modal for full recipe (ingredients + steps + calorie/macros + "Add to favorites" + "Add to weekly planner" buttons).

3) Favorites system for both workouts & meals

Each workout/meal card contains a heart icon button.

Clicking toggles favorite state:

add id to fw_favorites_workouts or fw_favorites_meals

update UI instantly (heart filled)

show toast "Added to favorites" or "Removed"

Add dedicated "Favorites" view that shows favorited items, with quick access.

4) Profile section (editable, local)

Profile page with:

Display name

About text (editable textarea)

Profile picture (file input, save as DataURL into fw_user_profile.avatarDataUrl)

"Save profile" button

Allow changing avatar via:

File input that reads file with FileReader and stores data:image/png;base64... in localStorage

Also allow selecting from preloaded avatar images in /images/avatars/*

Display profile summary in navbar with avatar & name.

All saved locally.

5) Workout & Meal details modals

Clicking a workout card:

Opens modal with: Title, difficulty, duration, equipment, targeted muscles, thumbnail (full size), description, calories estimate, "Play Video" if videoUrl present (embed or open in modal iframe), "Add to favorites", "Log workout" button (adds entry in fw_tracker_data).

Clicking a meal card:

Opens modal showing full recipe (ingredients, steps), macros, calorie info, image, "Add to favorites" & "Add to meal planner for day X".

Ensure modals are accessible (focus trap, ESC close, ARIA roles).

6) Tracker section — improve and add features

Replace "bland" tracker with a dashboard that includes:

Summary cards: Steps today, Calories burned today, Water intake, Workouts this week, Weekly calories, Current streak

Interactive charts using Canvas: Weight history (line), Steps (bar chart by day), Water intake (bar)

Log inputs: Quick forms to add steps, add weight, add water glasses, log a workout (choose workout id)

Achievements: Badge unlocks for milestones (e.g., 10k steps in a day, 7-day streak). Badges shown with tooltip and date unlocked.

Export/Import: Buttons to export fw_tracker_data as JSON downloadable file and import to restore.

Weekly summary & predictions: Basic projection of weekly steps based on current progress.

Use localStorage fw_tracker_data structure:

fw_tracker_data = {
  "2025-11-27": { steps: 8000, weight: 82.4, water: 2.5, workoutsLogged: [1,4] },
  "2025-11-26": { ... }
}

7) Find Friends (10 AI friends preloaded)

Preload 10 friend objects in FRIENDS array.

UI: A "Find Friends" card grid with avatar, name, interests, short bio, and "Add friend" button.

Clicking "Add friend" toggles to "Friends" and stores in fw_friends localStorage key.

Optionally show mutual interest highlighting: mark matches based on user's favorite workouts or tags.

Provide a "Message (demo)" button that opens a local-only chat modal to send messages (stored in localStorage per friend).

8) Find Trainers (10 trainers preloaded)

TRAINERS array with trainer objects: id, name, avatar, certifications, specialities, hourlyRate, rating, sampleReviews, availabilitySlots (dates).

UI: Trainer listings with filters (specialty, max rate, rating) and "Book session" button.

Bookings stored in fw_bookings. Booking flow: pick slot, enter name & notes, confirm, store booking locally, add to profile's "My Bookings".

Provide "Trainer profile" modal with detailed bio, specialties, certifications, and sample 1-week plan example.

9) Other UX polish

Toast notifications for actions (favorite added, profile saved, challenge day completed).

Smooth animations for adding/removing favorites.

Graceful offline-only warnings where external content would be used (e.g., YouTube).

Search boxes for workouts and meals (live filter).

Pagination or infinite load for long lists.

Implementation details (technical)

Render lists via JS templating functions that create DOM nodes and innerHTML sanitized.

Use event delegation for list click handlers.

Modal implementation:

append modal element to document.body

trap focus inside modal

ESC closes modal

Favorite toggle function signature:

function toggleFavorite(type, id) // type: 'workout'|'meal'


localStorage helper:

function lsGet(key, defaultVal) { /* parse JSON or return default */ }
function lsSet(key, value) { /* stringify and store */ }


Charts: Use Canvas 2D API — small helper functions to draw bars/lines; no external libs.

File input to DataURL: use FileReader.readAsDataURL(file) then store string in fw_user_profile.avatarDataUrl.

Image naming & usage policy

Meal images: images/meal-1.jpg, images/meal-2.jpg, ... matching MEALS ids. If user provided names differ, the code should attempt to find images/meal-${id}.jpg then fallback to images/placeholder-meal.jpg.

Workout thumbnails: images/workout-1.jpg, …

Avatars: images/avatar-1.jpg … or fallback images/avatar-placeholder.png

Trainer images: images/trainer-1.jpg, …

Use loading="lazy" on <img> tags for performance.

Testing checklist (must pass)

Open index.html via file:// — site loads with no server errors.

Click a workout opens accessible modal with details and favorite button works and persists after refresh.

Click a meal opens recipe modal; favorites persist.

Profile: change name, about, upload new avatar — persists and shows in navbar.

Challenges: start a challenge, mark daily completions, progress persists and updates UI / circular progress.

Tracker: add steps, weight, water; charts update and data persists.

Favorites page shows all favorites and allows removal.

Find Friends: add 1–2 friends; changes persist.

Find Trainers: book a trainer slot; booking saved to fw_bookings.

Export tracker data and import restore works.

All modals close with ESC and are keyboard-accessible.

No external network requests required for core functionality.

Deliverable formatting instructions for the generator

Produce only the 3 files: index.html, style.css, and script.js with comments.

Put all sample data in script.js — do not create extra JSON files.

Keep file sizes reasonable; use small inline SVG icons rather than remote icon fonts.

Write clear inline comments in script.js explaining functions and localStorage shape.

Include sample text for 20 workouts, 30 meals, 6+ challenges, 10 friends and 10 trainers (these can be stubbed but must be real-looking entries).

Make sure all relative image paths point to images/<name> so your local images folder is used.

Extra (optional but recommended)

Add a small README (displayed as a popup or comment in script.js) explaining how to add more images and the naming convention.

Add a data-sync toggle that can export the whole site state as JSON (download) so user can share profiles between devices.

Final note to the generator / developer

Make the UI feel polished and real — animations, toasts, small microinteractions — but ensure it stays fast and accessible. Everything must be testable with local files only and persist to localStorage. If any external content (like embed videos) is used, provide a local fallback (thumbnail + textual steps).
