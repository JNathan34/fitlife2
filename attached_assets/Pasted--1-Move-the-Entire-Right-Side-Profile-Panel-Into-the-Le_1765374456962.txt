✅ 1. Move the Entire Right-Side Profile Panel Into the Left Sidebar

Take all profile-related elements currently in the right column and relocate them into the left sidebar under the “Profile” menu item.

Include the following inside the Profile section in the left sidebar:
1. Profile avatar block

Use the circular avatar design shown in the screenshot (the dark mode version with the green status dot).

Display:

Username: Guest User

Subtext: Get Stronger

Make the block look identical in style to the bottom-left mockup screenshot you provided.

2. Theme toggle

Move the light/dark toggle into the Profile section and style it cleanly.

Requirements:

Smooth animation

Icon should switch (sun → moon)

Background, text, and the switch thumb fully adapt to both themes

Use consistent spacing (16px top/bottom padding)

3. Today’s Stats

Move these into the Profile area too:

Workouts

KCALS

(If calories, active days, or water stats exist, display them too)

Style guidelines:

Place stats in a small grid or vertical layout

Make them visually consistent with the rest of the UI

Labels should use the same small uppercase style (WORKOUTS, KCALS)

4. Remove the following items completely:

Notifications

Account Settings

Sign Out

These should not appear anywhere in the UI.

✅ 2. Fix Light Mode Completely (FULL THEME COVERAGE)

Right now, light mode only partially works.
Fix the theme system so every component switches correctly.

Elements that MUST correctly switch between themes:
Global

Body background

Sidebar background

Navbar / header background

All text colors (headings, subheadings, detail text, icons, labels)

All icons (swap to dark theme icons if necessary)

Hover states

Scrollbars

Cards

Meal cards

Workout cards

Dashboard cards

Profile section card

Popup/modals

Buttons

Tags (HIGH PROTEIN, VEGAN, DINNER, BREAKFAST etc.)

Shadows, borders, inner spacing

Buttons

Primary, secondary, ghost, icon buttons

Active/hover states

Pop-ups and overlays

Background color

Backdrop blur

Borders

Close button color

Font colors

Every single label, title, description, timer, nutrition label, and macro count should flip correctly in light mode.

Design goals for light mode:

Clean white and light-grey tones

Softer shadows

Darker text

Subtle accents

Keep consistency with the dark mode color palette

Feels bright but not washed out

Make it fully polished, like a premium app.

✅ 3. Update All Meal and Workout Images to Match Their Actual Names

Currently, many items use placeholder images (e.g., oatmeal = pizza).
Fix this so every card uses a unique, relevant, high-quality image.

Meals

Oatmeal → an actual oatmeal photo

Mediterranean Salad → real salad bowl

Steak & Asparagus → steak image

Quinoa bowl → quinoa bowl

Smoothie → smoothie in a glass

Pasta → chicken pesto pasta picture

Avocado toast → actual toast with avocado

Workouts

Each workout must have its own:

Matching photo (pushups → pushup photo, squats → squat photo)

Fresh, non-duplicated images

Images that visually match the workout title

Good lighting, good contrast, modern photography

✅ 4. Remove the Entire “Daily Fuel” Section from Dashboard

Delete this section entirely:

The title “Daily Fuel”

The image block

The nutritional recommendations

Any spacing created by its removal

The dashboard should shift upward and close the gap.

✅ 5. Fix the Workout Modal Cut-Off Bug

When opening a workout, the modal cuts off:

The close button

The “Log Workout” button

The lower description area

Fix requirements:

The modal should be vertically scrollable

OR reduce modal height to never exceed the viewport

Buttons must always be visible

Add proper padding at bottom

Prevent page scrolling when modal is open

Make the close button accessible

Ensure modal remains centered on all screen sizes

Make this feel like a mobile-friendly responsive modal.

✅ 6. Improve Overall Visual Quality Everywhere

Apply a global quality pass.

Fonts

More consistent font weights (400, 500, 600, 700)

Improve header hierarchy

Increase readability

Spacing

Fix inconsistent margin and padding

Increase breathing room around cards

Create perfect alignment between columns and rows

Cards

Add subtle rounded corners (10–16px)

Clean shadows

Uniform padding

Consistent layout for meal/workout metadata (time, calories, macros)

Icons

Clean up icon spacing

Use consistent sizes

Align icons with text perfectly

Buttons

Improve hover animations

More modern color transitions

Better contrast in light mode

Animations

Smooth the light/dark theme transition

Add soft hover scale or shadow effects for cards

Everything should feel premium and polished.

✅ 7. Add a Contact Form

Add a contact form to the site (you may decide where it fits best).

Form requirements:

Fields:

Name

Email

Message

Functionality:

Validation

Clean layout

Optional success message

Design:

Works in light + dark mode

Matches the app aesthetic

Subtle border-radius

Soft shadows

Inputs with clear focus state

Possible placements:

A new sidebar link called "Contact"

OR inside the Profile page

OR at bottom of the dashboard
Make whichever looks best.

✅ 8. Keep Everything Else the Same

Do not:

Delete working pages

Modify navigation structure

Change the dashboard layout except where stated

Remove meal/workout items

Break responsiveness

Only add the requested improvements.
