Make the following specific changes and additions to my current fitness website. Do not rebuild the site — only extend and modify what already exists.

1. Add a Meal Plan Sidebar (Left Side of Screen)
Layout & Position

Create a fixed left sidebar dedicated to Meal Plans.

The sidebar must remain visible at all times, even when scrolling.

Width should be around 250–300px (responsive on smaller screens).

Meal Content Requirements

For each meal category (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks):

Add a unique high-quality image for every meal.

Add:

Meal name

A short description

Ingredients list

A full step-by-step cooking guide (5–8 steps per meal)

Approximate calories

Functionality

Add a "Shuffle Meals" button at the bottom of the sidebar.

When pressed:

Replace all meals with completely different meals.

Images should update accordingly.

Content should fade-in or smoothly animate.

Responsiveness

On mobile/tablet:

The sidebar should collapse into a dropdown or slide-out panel.

2. Upgrade ALL Workouts (Main Section)
Workout Requirements

Every workout card must include:

A different picture (no repeats).

A unique workout name.

A detailed description of what muscles it targets.

6–10 step instructions on how to perform the movement safely.

A tip section (e.g., form tips, common mistakes).

Animation/Interaction

When switching workouts, use:

Smooth fade-in

Slide-up

Or card-flip animation (your choice)

Randomizer (Optional but Recommended)

Add a "Random Workout" or "Generate New Workout" button.

This should pull a completely new workout card with new content and image.

3. Profile Section Update (Right Side Panel)
Theme Toggle

Add a Light/Dark mode toggle inside the Profile panel.

The toggle should:

Be a switch button or icon-based toggle (sun/moon).

Instantly update the entire website theme.

Theme Appearance Changes

When changing themes, update:

Background colors (global page background)

Text colors (headers, paragraphs, labels, buttons)

Card backgrounds (workout cards, meal cards, profile card)

Sidebar background

Navigation elements

Shadows + borders

Button colors + hover states

Input fields (if any)

localStorage Feature

Save the user’s selected theme into localStorage.

On page load, automatically apply the stored theme.

Profile UI Improvements

Keep your current layout but ensure the toggle fits neatly.

Add subtle animation when switching modes (0.3–0.5s transition).

4. General UI & Functionality Improvements
Animations

Fade-in effects for images

Smooth transitions between light/dark mode

Hover effects on all cards

Smooth transitions when new meals/workouts load

Responsiveness

Entire layout must remain responsive on:

Phone

Tablet

Desktop

Sidebar and profile panel should become collapsible on smaller screens.

Styling Consistency

Use consistent border-radius, shadows, spacing, and font sizes.

Ensure the theme toggle adjusts the meal sidebar and workout section too.

5. Do NOT Remove or Change Existing Structure

Keep the current layout exactly as it is.

Only add:

The meal plan sidebar

The upgraded workout cards

The theme toggle

All additions must integrate cleanly with existing code.
